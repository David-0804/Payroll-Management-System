# Payroll Management System

A Payroll Management System built in C++ that automates employee salary processing, deductions, allowances, and pay-slip generation. The system replaces manual record-keeping with efficient file handling and provides a user-friendly interface for managing payroll operations.

📌 Introduction
The Payroll Management System is designed to organize employee payment tasks and tax filing. It calculates wages, withholds taxes and deductions, generates pay-slips, and stores records securely. This system reduces manual errors and saves time, making payroll management more efficient

🔑 Objectives
- Manage employee information efficiently.
- Define earnings, deductions, and leave.
- Generate pay-slips with a single click.
- Manage payroll according to salary structures.
- Generate reports related to employees, attendance/leave, and payroll.
- Provide secure access through login authentication.

🏗️ System Architecture & Modules
Admin Login Module
- Prompts user for login credentials.
- Grants access only to valid users.
Data Entry Module
- Allows insertion of employee details (Name, ID, Designation, Age, Experience, Hours worked, Loan status).
- Calculates salary, earnings, and deductions.
- Stores data permanently in files.
Storage & Retrieval Module
- Maintains employee records in files.
- Supports retrieval, editing, searching, and deletion of records.
- Records are stored line by line, with fields separated by tabs.

⚙️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Classes & Objects
- Functions
- File Handling

🚀 Working Procedure
- Program starts with intro() displaying a welcome message.
- User logs in with valid credentials.
- Employee records are retrieved from files.
- User navigates the main menu to perform operations (insert, edit, search, delete).
- Modified or new records are saved before exit.

📂 Project Functions (ADT)
- intro() → Displays introduction.
- login() → Handles authentication.
- menu() → Main menu navigation.
- insert() → Add new employee record.
- edit() → Modify existing records.
- list() → Display all records.
- deletes() → Remove a record.
- search() → Find a record.
- saverecords() / getrecords() → File handling for persistence.
- displayPayslip() → Generate employee pay-slip.

✅ Conclusion & Future Scope
This Payroll Management System improves efficiency by automating salary calculations and record management. It reduces manual errors, saves time, and provides readily available reports. Future enhancements could include:
- Database integration (MySQL/SQLite) instead of file handling.
- GUI interface for better usability.
- Cloud-based payroll management for scalability.

👉 You can copy this directly into your README.md file, then commit and push it with Git Bash using the commands we went over earlier.
Would you like me to also give you a short one-line tagline (for the GitHub repo description field, limited to 350 characters) so it looks polished on your repo’s front page?
